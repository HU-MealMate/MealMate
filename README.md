## Overview

### Description

- This app allows people to find restaurants around the city while also providing a detailed description and review and rating from past customers and critiques.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Food/Resturant

- **Mobile:** This app will have use Map and Location-based servies to find restaurants closest to the user. It will also have a camera functionality so that users can incorporate pictures into their restaurant reviews

- **Story:** This app will give its users info about the customer service, food quality, and the luxury level of a restaurant before they ever visit. By ensuring that the user knows what to expect from a restaurant before they go, this app minimizes unpleasant dining experiences.

- **Market:** This app has the potential to gain a huge audience and user base. Users of all ages will be able to use this app.  Some target niche group of users are tourist, new residents, and users age 18-30.  

- **Habit:** This app would be a medium habit forming app due to it catering to an essential to human life which is food. Tourist will open it to find good restaurants around them as well as the people who live around the restaurants.The average user will consume our app to view reviews as well create by providing reviews themseleves if they please.

- **Scope:** The app has a well-formed scope to finish it by the end of the program. A stripped down version of our app would be interesting to build because our point of the resturant ratings will still get across to the user.
